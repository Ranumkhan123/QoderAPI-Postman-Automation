## Qoder API ‚Äì Postman Automation Testing

This repository contains a **complete API testing & automation project** developed with Postman, which focuses on authentication, CRUD operations, negative¬†scenarios, schema validation, performance checks, reporting, and monitoring. It illustrates industry-standard procedures for automating and testing APIs.  


----


## About the API  

This project employs a unique API that I built with **Qoder ‚Äî The Agentic Coding Platform**.  
Qoder allowed me to create and deploy a fully functional CRUD API with authentication, which served as the foundation for this Postman-based automation project. Instead of depending solely on public APIs, I created my own to test **real-world API testing workflows** such as authentication, authorization, error handling, and data-driven testing.  


----


## Prerequisites

To perform these tests locally, you will need:

- Install the Postman Desktop Application or the Postman CLI (Newman).
-¬†The Qoder API server is currently running against a local instance at http://localhost:3000.


----


## Project Overview

The test suite is created for the **Qoder API** (based on **Qoder-The Agentic Coding Platform**) and includes:  

- **Authentication**: Token creation for secure requests.  
- **CRUD Operations**: Full Create, Read, Update (PUT/PATCH), and Delete flow with dynamic IDs.  
- **Negative Testing**: Includes several failure scenarios and error validations.  
- **Advanced Scripting**: Create test scripts for collections, folders, and requests.  
- **Schema Validation**: Using Ajv for JSON schema validation.  
- **Performance Checks**: Validation of response time and size with configurable thresholds.  
- **Monitors** ‚Üí Set Postman Monitor to run tests automatically.  
- **Automation Reports** ‚Üí HTML Extra reports created using Newman.

## Test Coverage

### Authentication
- **Generate Token** (used for securing all CRUD requests).  

### CRUD Items
- **Create Item**  
- **Get All Items** (stores all item IDs for later use).  
- **Get Specific Item** (random ID fetched dynamically from saved IDs).  
- **Update Item (PUT)**  
- **Partial Update Item (PATCH)**  
- **Delete Item (DELETE)**  

> All update & delete requests dynamically pick a **random item ID** from saved IDs.  


### Negative Scenarios
- No token (unauthorized)  
- Invalid token  
- Missing required fields  
- Non-existent IDs (404)  
- Empty body  
- Invalid field type ‚Üí Price & Name  
- Negative price  
- Very long string (boundary test)  
- Very large number (boundary test)  
- Invalid HTTP method  
- Unexpected fields  


### Delete Folder
- **Clear All Items**  
- **Clear Data**  


----


## Features

- **Dynamic Chaining**: IDs recorded in one request are reused in subsequent requests (e.g., GET, PATCH, and DELETE).  
- **Collection Level Tests**:  
  - Schema validation (based on Ajv)  
  - Validation of response time and size  
  - Validation of the root key and header  
  - Validity of JSON  
- **Folder Level & Request Level Tests**: Each request includes validations for both the happy path and negative scenarios.  
- **Monitor Setup**: Automated Postman Monitor is configured to conduct this collection on a scheduled basis.  
- **Data-driven Testing**: CSV is used for bulk data testing.  
- **Newman Execution**: Collection can be run¬†via CLI using.
- **HTML Extra Reports** saved in the'reports/' folder.  


---


## Test Scripts

Implemented at three levels:¬†

1. **Collection-level**:
   - The validity of JSON (Ajv).  
   - The response time threshold.  
   - The¬†Response size validation. 
   - Checking the headers (Content-Type, etc.).  
   - Validations for the root key. 

2. **Folder-level**:  
   - Shared schemas (e.g., authentication responses).  

3. **Request Level**  
   - Request-specific validations (status codes, body fields, and values).  


----


## Monitoring

- Postman **Monitor** is set to execute the collection at predetermined times.  
- Endpoint health checks are performed automatically.  
- Contributes to the detection of downtime and performance concerns.

## API Documentation

- - Swagger/OpenAPI documentation is accessible on **SwaggerHub**:
